# BAM! Engine
BAM! Engine is a game engine buit entirely (well, there is a bit of .json, HTML & CSS) in Python, and is very good for the making of 2D games, that aren't labour-intensive. Unlike Unity,
BAM! Engine (Project - Kaboom!) doesn't include any form of AI, nor was any used in the development. If you look in the repo, you will see a file called 'DevlogAndNotes.txt', that has
all of the notes and discoveries I made along the journey. At the start, it is very much focused on the ideas that go into the engine. Further on, it does into the development of it,
and other things.
